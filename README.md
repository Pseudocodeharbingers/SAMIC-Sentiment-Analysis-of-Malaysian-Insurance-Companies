# SAMIC-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Malaysian-Insurance-Companies
This repository contains the code for my final year project that implements a web application to visualize Malaysia’s best insurance companies. Twitter was used as a source of data in this project. The tweets extracted using dates and keywords were analyzed as it is one of the metrics that will advance insurance companies’ online presence. The data was first pre-processed, and the model is run on real-world data once the development of the machine learning models is completed. The model evaluation is conducted using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and two machine learning models have been built for classification purposes built based on the datasets in English and Bahasa Malaysia for multi-class text classification to represent the sentiment generation. Real-world data analysis results are visualized in a dashboard to make the analysis outcomes readable and understandable for the policyholders. Additionally, the web application also includes real-time monitoring of tweets sentiment that uses the data processing infrastructure and sentiment analyzer to evaluate public sentiment changes in response to user search keywords.
